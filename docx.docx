// similar to docker compose as we run services but we call them container definition here
// In docker compose we use a local docker file butin here we use the image on docker hub
// we use Elastic Container service
// this file is configured to work most especially with AWS
// EBS dones not know how to work with container
// we give ECS task definition
// It's the ECS that know how to run each container or images based on the task definition
// hostname is the refrence of the container instead of using the URL
// essential is when if marked true, if the container ever crashed the remaining container will be closed down
